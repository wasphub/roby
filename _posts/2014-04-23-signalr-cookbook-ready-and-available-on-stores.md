SignalR Real-time Application Cookbook ready and available on stores!
===

I've been quite silent lately, but I really needed to use all my spare time for my last adventure: [writing a technical book about Signalr](new-adventure-writing-a-book-about-signalr)! Well, the adventure is over and the book is now available on both the [Packt online store](http://www.packtpub.com/signalr-real-time-application-cookbook/book) and on [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/SignalR-Real-time-Application-Cookbook-Roberto/dp/1783285958/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1398281697&sr=8-3&keywords=signalr).

It's been a very interesting experience, from which I learned a lot about how tough writing a book is :) And I also improved a lot my knowledge about SignalR itself.

I just want to thank Packt for the opportunity and their support through the whole process, and all the reviewers who helped me improving the content.

Now, some rest and then back to work. Next adventure? Probably ElmahR 2.0 :) And for sure I'll try to write more here, I've been neglecting this blog quite a lot lately...
